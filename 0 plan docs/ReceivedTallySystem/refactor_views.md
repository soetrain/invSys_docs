Refactor views — Received Tally system
======================================

View 1 — Module consolidation (Before → After)
----------------------------------------------
```mermaid
C4Component
title BEFORE: scattered receiving logic

Boundary(Tally_b, "modTS_Tally") {
  Component(TallyRecv, "Receive-side routines", "mixed")
}
Boundary(Data_b, "modTS_Data") {
  Component(DataHelpers, "Data helpers", "helpers")
}
Boundary(Launch_b, "modTS_Launchers") {
  Component(LaunchRecv, "Launch receiving", "entrypoints")
}
Boundary(Log_b, "modTS_Log") {
  Component(LogRecv, "Received logging", "logging")
}
Boundary(Form_b, "frmReceivedTally") {
  Component(Form, "Legacy form", "UI")
}
Component(ItemSearch, "frmItemSearch", "UI")

Rel(ItemSearch, TallyRecv, "calls (add/merge)")
Rel(LaunchRecv, TallyRecv, "calls")
Rel(TallyRecv, DataHelpers, "uses")
Rel(TallyRecv, LogRecv, "uses")
Rel(Form, TallyRecv, "UI hooks")
```

```mermaid
C4Component
title AFTER: consolidated in modTS_Received

Boundary(Recv_b, "modTS_Received") {
  Component(AddMerge, "AddOrMergeFromSearch()", "proc")
  Component(Aggregate, "AggregateReceived()", "proc")
  Component(ValidateWrite, "ValidateAndWrite()", "proc")
  Component(WriteInvSys, "WriteInvSys()", "proc")
  Component(WriteReceivedLog, "WriteReceivedLog()", "proc")
}
Boundary(Undo_b, "modUndoRedo (helper)") {
  Component(MUndo, "MacroUndo()", "proc")
  Component(MRedo, "MacroRedo()", "proc")
}
Component(ItemSearch2, "frmItemSearch", "UI")
Component(ConfirmBtn, "Sheet Confirm button", "UI")

Rel(ItemSearch2, AddMerge, "add/merge into ReceivedTally")
Rel(ConfirmBtn, ValidateWrite, "trigger")
Rel(AddMerge, Aggregate, "refresh aggregated view")

Rel(ValidateWrite, WriteInvSys, "calls")
Rel(ValidateWrite, WriteReceivedLog, "calls")
Rel(MUndo, Aggregate, "undo staging/posted/log")
Rel(MRedo, Aggregate, "redo staging/posted/log")
```

View 2 — Runtime sequence (entry → confirm)
-------------------------------------------
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Search as frmItemSearch
    participant RT as ReceivedTally (list)
    participant AGG as AggregateReceived (list)
    participant CNF as Confirm macro
    participant INV as invSys.RECEIVED
    participant LOG as ReceivedLog
    participant UNDO as MacroUndo
    participant REDO as MacroRedo

    Search->>RT: add/merge item (sum duplicates)
    RT->>AGG: rebuild aggregated view

    AGG->>CNF: Confirm (if happy)
    CNF-->>INV: write rows
    CNF-->>LOG: write log entry
    CNF-->>CNF: validation fails → show error (no write)

    UNDO-->>RT: undo inserts/merges
    UNDO-->>AGG: undo staging
    UNDO-->>INV: undo posted rows
    UNDO-->>LOG: undo log entry

    REDO-->>RT: redo inserts/merges
    REDO-->>AGG: redo staging
    REDO-->>INV: redo posted rows
    REDO-->>LOG: redo log entry
```
